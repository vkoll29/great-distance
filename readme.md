## Great Distance 
#### Calculates the distance between two locations using haversine formula.
#### I have extended the project so you can find certain locations that are close enough to a particular central point.
#### For my working case, the locations are available in a json file (named partners.json here). You can obvously work with other formats and sources.
#### Actually, the locations list that I use here is a rather complicated file i.e it has other data in it, will work on working with simpler files that only have the cordinates

## Full Disclosure:
#### Part of this project was inspired by an interview session that I took part in. 
#### I didn't make it past this stage and the company was generous enough to provide me with feedback on where I went wrong (mostly had to do with lack of test suites). 
#### Thus, I am constantly using that feedback and together with my own ideas to improve the project.
